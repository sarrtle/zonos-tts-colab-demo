> - This repository is **not affiliated** with the original repository [Zyphra/Zonos](https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos). I created this **Google Colab demo** to test the model after facing issues on their playground, as well as on **DeepInfra** and **HuggingFace**. I decided to use **Google Colab** as an alternative solution.
